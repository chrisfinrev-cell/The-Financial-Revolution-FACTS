# Financial Revolution (FACTS)

## What this app does
FACTS — Financial Allocation Control & Tracking System — helps users replace passive budgeting with active income allocation across 6 purpose-driven categories (Necessities, Velocity, Reserve, Lifestyle, Growth, Legacy) on the path to financial sovereignty.

## Stack
Express.js + PostgreSQL (Neon) + vanilla JS frontend, served as static HTML from `/public`.

## Directory map
- `server.js` — legacy god file (33k lines); entry point, all legacy routes. Do not add to it.
- `modules/` — pluggable feature modules (mod_analytics, mod_gamification, mod_ssc, etc.). New features go here.
- `migrations/` — node-pg-migrate style JS migrations (`{timestamp}_{name}.js`).
- `public/` — static HTML/CSS/JS served by Express static middleware.
- `services/` — legacy Twilio wrapper only.
- `jobs/` — affiliate commission job runner.
- `scripts/` — one-off seed/setup scripts.
- `tfr_vault_services/` — TFR vault module (loaded by module-loader).
